# Technical Evaluation Report: Developer Assistant Bot.

## Executive Summary

This report presents a detailed analysis of the Developer Assistant Bot's (DevBot's) performance and its impact on our development team, compared to the potential contributions and limitations of a newly hired fresher. Utilizing data from a recent internal survey and industry-standard benchmarks, we illustrate DevBot's efficiency, accuracy, and learning enhancement capabilities against the typical ramp-up period, error rate, and productivity levels expected from a new developer.

## Introduction

The integration of AI tools in software development has promised significant efficiency improvements and error reduction. Our organization's implementation of the Developer Assistant Bot (DevBot) aims to leverage these advancements. In contrast, hiring freshers is a traditional approach to scaling teams but comes with inherent challenges like longer ramp-up times and initial lower productivity levels.

## Current Setup and Methodology

The initial rollout of the Developer Assistant Bot (DevBot) was strategically limited to a select group of 17 individuals within our organization. This cohort represents a diverse range of experiences ( 2-8 years) and specialties, including:

- UI Development: Developers with experience in frontend technologies and user interface design.
- Backend Development: Team members specializing in server-side logic, databases, and application architecture, also with experience ranging from 2 to 8 years.
- AWS Development: Individuals skilled in cloud services, specifically Amazon Web Services, reflecting the same experience spectrum.
- Junior AI Developers: Emerging talents with a focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning, beginning their career journey with up to 2 years of experience.

This targeted approach was designed to assess the impact of DevBot across different levels of expertise and development areas. By providing access to a broad yet experienced segment of our development team, we aimed to gather comprehensive insights into how the bot can augment existing workflows, improve productivity, and facilitate learning and development across diverse technical disciplines.

ðŸ’¡ In addition to the general capabilities of the Developer Assistant Bot, we introduced a specialized feature designed specifically for our UI Development team. This feature enables the direct conversion of HTML designs into functional code, streamlining the development process by automating a traditionally manual and time-consuming task.

Data were collected via a structured approach targeting existing development team members who have interacted with DevBot and through historical performance metrics of newly hired developers within their first six months.

## Analysis and Findings

### Time Management and Efficiency

- **DevBot**: 57% of developers reported a 'Significant Reduction' in time spent on coding tasks, with an additional 43% noting a 'Somewhat Reduced' time. This contrasts sharply with the typical fresher's ramp-up time, which usually extends over several months before reaching full productivity.
    
    
- **Fresher**: Average ramp-up time to reach full productivity is estimated at 3-6 months(best case), during which code output and efficiency are substantially lower than those of experienced developers.

### Accuracy and Quality

- **DevBot**: All participants rated the solution accuracy as 'Mostly Accurate,' contributing to a notable increase in code quality, with 71% reporting 'Significant Improvement' and 29% noting 'Some Improvement'.
- **Fresher**: Freshers typically have a higher error rate, estimated at 15-25% higher than that of an experienced developer, which can impact overall code quality and project timelines.

### Learning and Development

- **DevBot**: Promotes continuous learning with 29% of developers experiencing significant improvement in their skills and 71% noting moderate improvements. It serves as a real-time, always-available resource for best practices and problem-solving techniques. The numbers are lesser than what we anticipated as the model was restricted to our tech stack.
- **Fresher**: While freshers bring new knowledge and perspectives, they require significant investment in training and mentorship to become fully effective, often diverting resources from other projects.

## Economic Impact

Considering the salary and training costs associated with new hires versus the implementation and maintenance costs of DevBot, the bot presents a cost-effective solution. 

Moreover, the reduction in coding time and error rates translates directly into cost savings and increased project delivery speed. Specifically, DevBot reduces the time experienced developers need to spend training freshers, estimated to save on average 40 hours per developer per month. Additionally, by minimizing common coding errors and improving code quality, DevBot significantly reduces the time required for pull request (PR) reviews. On average, this can lead to a ~10% reduction in time spent on PR reviews, further enhancing team productivity and accelerating development cycles.

These time savings not only have a direct economic impact by freeing up developer hours for more value-add activities but also indirectly benefit the organization by enabling faster sprint turnaround and increased capacity for handling more projects or refining existing products.

## Conclusion

The Developer Assistant Bot significantly outperforms the typical output and efficiency of a newly hired fresher in several key areas, including time management, code accuracy, and quality. While freshers are invaluable assets for Qyrus in long-term growth and diversification, DevBot provides immediate efficiency gains, reduces error rates, and enhances the existing team's learning curve without the associated ramp-up time and costs. The data advocate for augmenting our development teams with such AI tools to complement and enhance their capabilities while continuing to invest( although at much reduced rate) in fresh talent for sustainable growth.

## Recommendations

Based on the findings, it is recommended to continue the integration of DevBot within our development teams while also developing strategies for effective onboarding and training of freshers to harness the best of both worlds: the efficiency and consistency of AI and the creativity and growth potential of new human talent. We would ideally propose to invest time on the following,

1. Integrate the model directly into the IDE of the developers and testers.
2. Focus on separately training models for UI development, Backend and Database respectively.
3. Train the bot on our codebase.
4. Collect these metrics directly from the IDE.
5. Train the bots on our role based typical workflows like,
    1. FIGMA to HTML
    2. HTML to API Integration.
    3. Terraform/CDK for AWS setup
    4. Support bot.
    5. PR Review bot.
